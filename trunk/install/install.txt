myGovernance Install Document

Requirements:
 - PHP 4
 - MySQL 4
 - Apache 1.3 or greater

Description:
myGovernance is a corporate reporting support tool.

Procedure:
As with most projects, the most up to date copy of the system is stored in the CVS repository on GForge. A CVS checkout will produce a copy of the system. Some adult assembly may be required.

Installation
Extract the myGovernance archive file to a directory and copy the folder to the target location. 
Edit the config.inc.php file to assign the host, database, username and password details. The defaults for this file are fine for a standard release (apart from the database settings).
Execute the install.sql document against a MySQL database to create the basic structure.

LDAP Special Notes
myGovernance supports LDAP authentication using a similar param method as Joomla! 1.5, the 1.5 LDAP plugin settings will work appropriate for myGovernance
