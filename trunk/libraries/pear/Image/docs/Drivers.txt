Driver Status
--------------
GD support split into JPEG and PNG driver - GIF and WBMP driver added
PDF support using PDFlib (http://www.pdflib.com/), PEAR's File_PDF does not provide output
SWF created using MING library (http://ming.sourceforge.net/) - can't figure out those darn gradients, libswf in TO-DO, SWF text output doesn't seem to work on Win32
SVG uses a internal SVG creation method, XML_SVG does not seem to support enough functionality
